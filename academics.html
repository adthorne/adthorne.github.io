I have gotten mostly A’s in my academic career, with only one or two B’s. I have taken most of my classes as honors, with multiple AP classes as well. I have excelled in almost every subject, while only being slightly weak in science. I am most comfortable in ELA and math, while also being rather strong in social studies. <img src="assets/math_worksheet.jpg" alt="Someone doing a math worksheet" width="128" height="85.3" class="image_float_right"/> I am confident in the AP scores for the AP classes that I have taken and believe that they accurately reflect how well I do in school. I can quickly and efficiently finish work given to me inside of school, whether it be projects, assignments, or assessments. I have also been able to do well in hard subjects, such as precalculus, while having notoriously bad teachers.
