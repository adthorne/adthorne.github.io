	          <p><img src="assets/selfie.png" alt="Image of Aedan" width="106" height="129.3" class="image_float_left"/>My name is Aedan Thorne. I am currently a 17-year-old rising senior in high school. I generally do well in school, with most of my grades being Aâ€™s, and I have also had a job in retail which improved my communication skills. I really enjoy stories, mostly historical events, specifically political battles, and fiction books. I am interested in going into a job in either computer science or something related to history, or perhaps a mix of both. I also enjoy working on computers and creating online worlds for people to enjoy.

	<p>I also enjoy traveling to places that hold historical importance, such as Greece or Rome. I have visited places such as these many times, since looking at and interacting with places that once held some of the mightiest empires in the world is incredibly interesting, especially once you learn the history of these areas. I find that looking at old buildings that once held incredible significance to the inhabitants of an area to powerfully resonant and somewhat humbling.</p> <br>
