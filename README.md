My name is Aedan Thorne and my email address is adthorne@my.waketech.edu
My Github account is the place where my website is currently posted.
The repository that I just created is all of the files that go into my website.
The way that I cloned my repository onto my local machine was by setting up a site on the website version of Github, thenm cloning this repository on the desktop version, then adding my website files to the desktop version and publishing those changes onto this repository.
